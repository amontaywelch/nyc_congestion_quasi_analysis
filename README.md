# NYC Rideshare: Quasi-Experimental Analysis of Congestion Pricing Impact

This analysis aims to understand the initial impact of New York City's newly implemented 
"congestion fee" within the city's ridesharing landscape, with a focus on the Central 
Business District and its surrounding boroughs. By doing this, high-volume ridesharing companies such 
as Uber and Lyft can take these trends to better position drivers, adjust pricing strategy, 
and most importantly, retain the existing customer base.

## Project Background

On January 5, 2025, the city of New York officially kick-started a $1.50 "congestion fee" 
applied to ridesharing trips in Manhattan, south of and including 60th Street. Traveling 
by car in such a densely populated area can be a pain for both drivers and riders. Drivers 
are required to enter one of the most congested urban corridors in the country, while riders 
now have to pay an extra fee on top of standard rates, potentially causing frustration on 
both sides. This matters because the city thrives on ridesharing, drivers need to feel 
rewarded for providing a critical service, and customers need to feel like the service 
isn't just trying to take money from them.

## Data Source

The data is from the [NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page), 
where each month has records of all ridesharing trips, whether from ridesharing companies 
or taxi services. The months covered in this analysis are October-December 2024 and 
February-April 2025, with January 2025 purposely omitted since it marked the start of 
the fee. The dataset contained 6 individual files totaling just over **120 million records**. 
This dataset was chosen because it is from an official source, and the scale and depth 
of the data enables meaningful statistical analysis.

## Methodology

This analysis follows a **quasi-experimental design**, using NYC's congestion pricing 
implementation as a natural cutoff to measure behavioral change in rideshare patterns. 
Rather than a traditional A/B test, this approach leverages a real-world policy event 
to compare behavior before and after a known intervention.

The before period (Oct-Dec 2024) and after period (Feb-Apr 2025) were deliberately 
chosen to be symmetric (three months on each side) to avoid one period statistically 
dominating the other. January 2025 was omitted as the implementation month, where 
rider and driver behavior was expected to be erratic and inconsistent.

Raw Parquet files were sourced directly from the NYC TLC website, loaded into 
Google Cloud Storage, then ingested into Google BigQuery for analysis. Data cleaning 
removed invalid records including zero distance trips, negative fares, and unrealistic 
outliers, resulting in only **0.13% of records being removed** and preserving 99.87% 
of the original dataset.

Analysis was conducted in BigQuery using SQL, with visualizations built in Python 
via Google Colab and a summary dashboard built in Looker Studio. All tools were 
chosen to reflect a real-world product analytics workflow within the Google Cloud 
ecosystem.

## Key Findings

- **Manhattan saw the steepest decline:** Trip volume dropped **4%** in the three months 
  following fee implementation, nearly double the citywide rate of **2.4%**.

- **The Bronx bucked the trend:** The Bronx saw a **2% increase** in trip volume 
  post-implementation, suggesting possible trip displacement from Manhattan to 
  outer borough destinations.

- **Congestion pricing made trips faster:** Manhattan's average trip duration decreased 
  by nearly **2 minutes** after the fee, providing evidence that the policy achieved its 
  core goal of reducing traffic congestion.

- **Morning commuters were undeterred:** Trips between **7AM and 10AM** showed a notable 
  increase in volume after the fee, suggesting work commuters view the $1.50 charge as 
  an acceptable cost for a necessary trip.

- **Airport trips saw the highest volume declines:** While LaGuardia and JFK Airports 
  saw the greatest raw volume declines among all zones, outer borough destinations such 
  as Bronx Park and Brooklyn Navy Yard saw steeper percentage declines, suggesting 
  congestion pricing is reshaping trip patterns well beyond Manhattan.

- **No dramatic month-over-month swings:** Trip volume remained consistent across the 
  analysis period, suggesting a sustained behavioral shift rather than a temporary 
  reaction to the fee.

## Revenue Impact

Analysis of gross booking data reveals a **$95.8M decline** in total gross bookings 
across the three month after period compared to the before period, averaging 
approximately **$32M per month**. This includes an **$85.2M drop in base fares** 
and a **$10.7M decline in tips**, the latter having direct implications for driver 
earnings in the post-fee environment.

![Overall revenue loss](nyc_rideshare_total_revenue_lost.png)

Manhattan alone accounted for **$50.2M of the $95.8M total decline**, representing 
52% of all gross booking losses despite making up only 34% of total trips. This 
disproportionate impact confirms the congestion zone as the primary driver of 
revenue loss and the highest priority area for retention strategies.

It is important to note that this comparison is not perfectly isolated. December 
2024 is a historically high volume month due to holiday travel, which may inflate 
the before period baseline. Part 2 will conduct a true year-over-year comparison 
to more accurately isolate the revenue impact of congestion pricing from seasonal variation.


## Recommendations

Based on the findings of this analysis, the following recommendations are proposed 
for ridesharing companies operating in New York City:

- **Introduce a loyalty discount during peak congestion hours:** With Manhattan trips 
  declining 4%, retaining core riders through targeted discounts during high-fee periods 
  could offset churn among cost-sensitive users without sacrificing overall revenue.

- **Implement a congestion pay incentive for drivers:** As tips decline and Manhattan 
  becomes less financially attractive, a congestion-specific pay boost would keep driver 
  supply stable in the zone and prevent service degradation in the city's highest demand area.

- **Reposition drivers toward outer boroughs:** The Bronx saw a 2% increase in trip 
  volume post-implementation, signaling displaced demand. Proactively incentivizing drivers 
  to cover outer borough zones captures growing demand before competitors do.

- **Launch airport-specific promotions for loyalty members:** While LaGuardia and JFK 
  saw the highest volume declines, targeted flat-rate or fee-absorbed airport ride offers 
  for loyalty members could recover this high-value trip segment.

- **Develop a morning commuter subscription pass:** 7-10AM trips increased post-fee, 
  proving commuters view the $1.50 charge as an acceptable cost. A subscription-based 
  commuter pass targeting daily Manhattan commuters would lock in reliable demand and 
  build long-term rider retention.

| Google Colab | Python environment for data visualization |
| Looker Studio | Summary dashboard and data presentation |

## Next Steps: Part 2

This analysis represents Part 1 of a broader investigation into NYC congestion 
pricing's impact on rideshare behavior, a stepping stone into a grander analysis. 
The quasi-experimental design was intentional: to test whether the implementation 
has started to show a measurable trend in the immediate aftermath of the policy.

Part 2 will expand to a full year-over-year comparison (2024 vs 2025), which will 
determine whether the congestion fee is producing lasting behavioral change or 
whether riders and drivers are simply adapting back to previous patterns.

Specifically, Part 2 will examine:

- Whether the initial behavioral shifts observed here persisted or normalized over time
- Seasonal patterns and how congestion pricing interacts with summer and holiday travel
- Long-term fare and tipping trends as riders fully adapt to the new pricing environment
- Whether outer borough impacts show delayed effects not captured in this initial window
- Driver earnings and how congestion pricing affected the supply side of the market
